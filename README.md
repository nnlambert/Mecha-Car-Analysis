# Mecha Car Analysis

### Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management to help with a special project. 
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles. 
There are a number of issues surrounding the vehicle’s specifications and manufacturing process that are blocking 
the manufacturing team from proceeding. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team 
to help analyze the production data in order to justify some last-minute design decisions. With Jeremy’s help, 
the launch of the MechaCar should be one of the most successful product launches in the company’s history.

From the upper management team, Jeremy received two datasets:

The results of an mpg testing dataset of 50 potential prototype MechaCars.
The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify 
ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, 
spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance were collected for each vehicle.
MechaCar suspension coil test results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, 
the weight capacity of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across lots.

### Objectives
- Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
- Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
- Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
- Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
